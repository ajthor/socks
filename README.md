__NOTE__: SOCKS is still under active (alpha) development ðŸš§ðŸ‘·ðŸš§. Code is provided
as-is, and some algorithms may not work as intended before the initial release. Please
check back soon for the official release.

SOCKS is a suite of algorithms for stochastic optimal control using kernel methods.

It runs on top of [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com), and comes with several classic
controls Gym environments. In addition, it can integrate with many pre-existing Gym
environments.

## Installation

To install the toolbox, use `pip install gym-socks`. Alternatively, download the code
from the GitHub repo and install using `pip install .` from the code directory.

We support Python versions 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 on Linux and macOS. We do not officially
support Windows.

## Examples

SOCKS comes with several examples in the GitHub repo. In order to run the examples,
first install the package and use `python examples/<example>` from the code directory.

For example, `python python examples/control/tracking.py` will run the optimal control
algorithm on the tracking benchmark using nonholonomic vehicle dynamics.
