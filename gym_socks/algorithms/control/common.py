"""Common functions for kernel control algorithms.

This file contains common functions used by the kernel optimal control algorithms, and
implements an LP solver to compute the probability vector :math:`\gamma`. This
functionality is accessed via the :py:func:``compute_solution`` function, which serves
as a single entrypoint, and the unconstrained version is chosen if the constraint matrix
``D`` is None.
