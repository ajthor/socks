Contributing
============

Notice a bug? Have a feature idea? Interested in contributing an algorithm?

There are many ways to contribute to SOCKS, and we welcome and encourage collaborators
to point out `issues <https://github.com/ajthor/socks/issues>`_, `post ideas
<https://github.com/ajthor/socks/discussions>`_, and (preferably) submit pull requests.

SOCKS is currently under active (alpha) development, meaning we are still in the early
stages of ironing out the way things work and developing the underlying framework of
SOCKS. We have a lot of great inspiration from existing libraries such as `OpenAI gym
<https://github.com/openai/gym>`_, `scikit-learn
<https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`_, `scipy
<https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_, and more, but are still working on finding better
ways to interact with the algorithms in SOCKS.

Some Ways That You Can Help
---------------------------

1. Number one is to submit pull requests. We :octicon:`heart;1em;sd-text-danger` pull
   requests.
2. Submit feedback using the GitHub `issues
   <https://github.com/ajthor/socks/issues>`_ page, and tag your suggestions or feedback
   so that we know whether you're asking a question, posting about a bug, or would like
   to propose the next big idea.
3. Discussion. We'd love to hear how you are using SOCKS, or how you plan to use it in
   your own research or projects. Check out the `discussions
   <https://github.com/ajthor/socks/discussions>`_ page to get in touch.
4. Documentation. We have made an effort to fully document SOCKS, but know there is
   always room for improvement. If you notice the documentation is lacking, or even if
   you notice a typo, we encourage you to reach out and submit an issue or a PR to help
   fix it.

Contributor Covenant
--------------------

We try our best to adhere to the |Contributor_Covenant|_, meaning, in short:

    We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
    diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We aim to make SOCKS a positive environment for all.



However, while we encourage users to submit bug reports, feature requests, and PRs, we
do not consider issues that are "homework" questions or "help solve my specific problem"
type issues-we simply don't have time. These issues will be marked as
:bdg-secondary:`off-topic` or :bdg-secondary:`wontfix`.
