# Maximal Stochastic Reachability

This example demonstrates the stochastic reachability algorithm to compute the maximal
policy in the terminal (first) sense.

By default, the system is a double integrator (2D stochastic chain of integrators).

To run the example, use the following command:

```shell
    python -m examples.reach.stoch_reach_maximal
```
